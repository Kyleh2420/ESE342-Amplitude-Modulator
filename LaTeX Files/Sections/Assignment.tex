\section{Assignment}

Design an amplitude modulator using a variable gain amplifier, such as the HMC694LPE. The baseband signal is given by

\begin{equation}\label{message}
    x(t) = 0.5cos(2 \pi f_0 t) + 0.5cos(4 \pi f_0t)\ V
\end{equation}


The carrier frequency is generated using a dielectric resonator oscillator with an output power of 15dBm at a frequency of 10GHz. The modulated signal should have a mean power of 15dBm with a modulation depth of $\pm$ 5 dB. Download the data sheets of the components from the manufacturer or distributor websites to design your modulator circuit to meet the specifications.
