\section{Dielectric Resonator Oscillator}

Instead of using a Dielectric Resonator Oscillator (DRO), we have elected to use a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO). In our research, we found VCOs to be more readily available over DROs. Additionally, the specific VCO used in this project, the DRO10000A from \textit{Z-Communications}, offers a typical power of 0dBm. Thus, we can achieve our desired center power of 15dBm strictly using the Variable Gain Amplifier without any additional amplifiers. A 0dBm VCO was also chosen due to the power limit of 5dBm on the VGA. This does deviate from the assignment prompt, however, we feel as though the chosen method is superior to the original request. If we were to use a DRO at 15dBm, as originally requested, an attenuator would be required, adding complexity and cost to the project.
