\section{Introduction}

This report will lay out the design and construction of an Amplitude Modulator with a 10GHz carrier wave. The core of the modulator is a HMC694LPE from \textit{Analog Devices}. Additionally, the design uses a OPA207 Operational Amplifier from \textit{Texas Instruments}, a DRO10000A from \textit{Z-Communications}, and a 30dB attenuator from \textit{Mini-Circuits}. Resistances are assumed to be standard, according to the E24 standard. Common positive power rails are also assumed to be available, such as 5 volts, 10 volts, and 12 volts, with unlimited current draw for each rail. A standard impedance of 50$\Omega$ is also assumed throughout this project.
