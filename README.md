# ESE342-Amplitude-Modulator
A project for Stony Brook University's ESE 342: Communication Systems which will encode a tonal message as an amplitude modulated wave, similar to that of a radio station.

To see the final report, check out the PDF file in the root repository.

Utilizing a frequency of 10GHz as the carrier frequency, we simulated the transmission of a given tonal baseband signal using commercially available parts. The simulation had to reflect real world scenerios, and therefore the mathmatical simulation is exactly what would occur had we brought the parts to put the project together. 

The parts simulated in this project are as follows:
- DRO10000A from Z-Communications
- HMC694LPE from Analog Devices
- OPA20 from Texas Instruments
- LT1206 from Analog Devices
- YAT-30A+ from Mini Circuits
